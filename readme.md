# Simplified Five card draw poker game

## Instructions
Script was written in python 3.10.

From command prompt or your terminal cd into the Poker directory and run `python main.py` on windows or `python3 main.py` on linux.

The Script will shuffle a standard 52 deck of cards and display your hand on the screen and, will promt you with the highest possible hand that you have at your disposal

## Future Plans

I would like to incorporate a game vs the computer, that checks various use cases for higher cards.
